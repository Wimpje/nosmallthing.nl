My site is built with Svelte. This is how you run it:

---


```bash
cd nosmallthing.nl
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see the site running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.


### Deploy to the web

I'm using netlify (which is pretty awesome). Deploy is done automatically when the ```master``` branch is pushed to the Github repo. Yeah, that's all...
